Feel free to try it anyway, but let me know if anything is unclear at any point, as the study implicitly assumes that the basics of IDE usage are known.;Do you have experience with 3D video games for desktop PCs?;Have you ever used the program **SpotBugs** (previously FindBugs)?;Have you ever used the program **JabRef**?;Can you use the programming language Java?;Warning in advance: If you have not worked with Java before, this study could be difficult. Feel free to try it anyway, but let me know if anything is unclear at any point, as the study implicitly assumes that you know the basics of object-oriented programming.;"Thank you for your answers! Here is a brief explanation of _SEE_. **Please read this explanation carefully!** 
SEE stands for _""Software Engineering Experience""_ and is a program that is intended to help you understand complex software. For this purpose, the source code of the software being examined is represented in the form of 3D cities. Each class is represented as a single building. The city is hierarchically structured: classes are contained in packages, which in turn are contained in other packages. In SEE, this is represented in that each building (class) is located within another area (package). You can navigate this city in the same way as in 3D video games, by moving the mouse and using the W/A/S/D keys.";s1expl2;In this image, you can see such a city. Here we see packages as blue rectangles and classes as white/red blocks. It is important to note that the **larger** a block is, the more **lines of code** it has. The **redder** a block is, the more **methods** it has. The project for this task is called SpotBugs. This is a program that is supposed to automatically find bugs in Java programs using static analysis. [Please click here to watch a short explanatory video about SEE.](https://youtu.be/WE21naXp\_YM) SpotBugs is also used as a code city in this video.;"The control and use of SEE is explained in the video, and the pressed keys are shown at the bottom of the video. Here is a brief summary (but please watch the video, as it contains important details):

- W/A/S/D: Forward/Left/Backward/Right (hold Shift: faster movement)
- Right mouse pointer: Hold down and move the mouse to change the viewing angle
- Mouse pointer on a block: Displays class/package names and possibly edges to parent classes
- Click on a block: Keep the edges displayed
- Scroll the mouse wheel with the mouse pointer on the city: Zoom in/out the city
- Ctrl + middle mouse button: Move the mouse to move the city
- Right-click on a block: Open the context menu
- Tab: Open the search menu
- Alt+F4: Close SEE

Please now unpack the downloaded SEE.zip and run SEE.exe (SEE.x86_64 under Linux). When unpacking under Windows, please use a program like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org), as the native Windows unpacker sometimes has problems with deeply nested archives. Familiarize yourself with the controls and see if you can follow the explanation above. Try to work on the example task below. If any problems occur, it is also no problem to close and reopen SEE at any time. If you have any further questions or if something does not work even after restarting SEE, you can contact me by email ([falko1@uni-bremen.de](mailto:falko1@uni-bremen.de)), on Telegram ([t.me/falko17](https://t.me/falko17)) or on Discord (falko17).";Find the class **AbstractDominatorsAnalysis**.

Example: Class A inherits from B, Class B inherits from C, Class C inherits from Object (which is not in the project). In this case, the base class of A is Class C.";baseexample;To make sure this term is clear: Please select the base class of **HouseCat**.;"Great, that was correct!

Now only the VSCode part is missing. Here's a brief explanation of _Visual Studio Code_ (VSCode). **Please read this explanation carefully!** VSCode is an IDE, i.e., an Integrated Development Environment. For this task, however, we only need the display and navigation features, so no code needs to be modified. 

For some of the tasks, you'll need [this table of metrics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z2AQDk2-XeVBB1kAtcpc18mFkPI5ZSsSz_yOwS4pQ88/edit?usp=sharing) about the project, please open it in a new tab. Here, associated metrics are available for each Java class. Most columns are self-explanatory, but to highlight a few things:  
- LOC indicates the number of lines of code in the class.
- Num_Methods indicates the number of methods in the class.
- By clicking on the arrow next to the letter at the top of one of the columns, you can sort the table by the values in that column.
- If you're more comfortable with an offline program like Excel, you can also download the file under ""File → Download"".

Please now unzip the downloaded VSCode.zip. On Windows, please use a program like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to unzip, as the native Windows unpacker sometimes has problems with deeply nested archives. For the tasks, you need a **JDK 21**. If you don't have one installed, on Windows, please run the microsoft-jdk MSI file included in the zip file to install the JDK. If you're using Linux, you'll probably know what to do (the installation differs depending on the distro—contact me if you need help). Afterwards, you can open VSCode by running the vscode.bat (or vscode.sh on Linux) file included in the folder. First, you'll be asked if you trust the authors of this folder, please select ""Yes"" here. On Windows, you might also get firewall requests, please allow these as well so that dependencies can be downloaded. Then follow the instructions below to prepare VSCode for the tasks.";v2expl2;"Now, please look at the bottom left. It should say ""Java: Lightweight Mode"", and next to it there's probably a loading indicator (in the screenshot above, the red arrow points to the loading indicator). Please wait until the loading process is complete. This can take quite a while—up to 5 minutes on Windows (you can continue reading in the meantime). *It's okay if something like ""Gradle Error"" appears on the right at the end. The main thing is that ""Java: Lightweight Mode"" is on the left and there's no loading process running next to it.* 

Here's a brief explanation of some VSCode features that are useful for the tasks:  
- On the left side is the folder structure as a tree. Only the ""src"" folder is relevant for the tasks, so you can ignore the other folders and files.
- With Ctrl+P, you can search for files by filename. Since in Java projects, a Java file contains exactly one class (at least you can assume so here), you can use this to search for classes by adding "".java"" to the end of your search.
- If you hold down Ctrl and then click on code elements, you can jump to their definition. In the screenshot below, clicking on the parent class SimpleCommand would, for example, open the file ""SimpleCommand.java"".";v2expl4;"The project for this task is called JabRef. This is a bibliography manager, which is a program used for managing scientific literature. 

Familiarize yourself with the VSCode interface and see if you can understand the explanation above. Try to work on the example task below. If you have any questions, you can contact me via email (falko1@uni-bremen.de), on Telegram (t.me/falko17) or on Discord (falko17).";Find the class **CapitalizeFormatter**.
