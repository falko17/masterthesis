\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}

\lettrine[lines=3]{\textcolor{Maroon}{U}}{ltimately}, having now successfully completed both the implementation and the user study, we are ready to conclude this thesis.
In this final chapter, we do so by first pointing out some limitations of the work presented here, mentioning some possibilities of future expansions, and finally, by offering some closing remarks.

\section{Limitations}
We will first go over a few ways in which the implementation and user study are limited.

\subsection{Implementation}

\paragraph{Possible Bugs}
% Problems in e.g. rust city
\fxfatal{}

\paragraph{Performance}
% Performance still not the best
\fxfatal{}

\paragraph{\Gls{ls} Differences}
% Not all LS so far support symbols
% Differences between LS's
% Push diagnostics still possibly not collected in ideal way
\fxfatal{}

\paragraph{City Editor}
% So far only in Unity Editor, not in-game
\fxfatal{}

\subsection{Evaluation}
\fxfatal{}
% Has not checked LSP specifically

\section{Future Work}
\fxfatal{}

% Editing too
% Outside of SEE
% Unplanned capabilities

\section{Closing Remarks}
