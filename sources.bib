Therefore, there is an absolute necessity to explicitly report the strength and direction of r while reporting correlation coefficients in manuscripts. This article aims to familiarize medical readers with several different correlation coefficients reported in medical manuscripts, clarify confounding aspects and summarize the naming practices for the strength of correlation coefficients.},

  abstract = {Software development is a complex undertaking composed of several activities that include reading, writing, and modifying source code. Indeed, previous studies have shown that the majority of the effort invested in software development is dedicated to understanding code. This includes understanding the static structure, dynamic behaviour, and evolution of the code. Given these particular characteristics, as well as the high complexity of source code, it is reasonable to consider how visualisation can facilitate source code understanding. This work proposes to extend existing software development tools with visualisations that can be used to encode the various complex features within a source code document. Further, this work establishes a design space which includes a series of visualisations that are meant to complement existing textual views of source code, as found in source code editors. Several prototype visualisations are presented in this work which utilise various visualisation techniques, such as tree visualisations techniques and visualisation techniques based on the code-map metaphor. This work also presents several experiments, where the results of these experiments indicate that combining existing software development tools with visualisations can have a positive effect on source code understanding. Additionally, the result of the experiments show that the less a visualisation is abstracted from the original textural representation of a source code document, in terms of line, token, ordering, and character information, the more likely it is that viewers can link the visualisation to the code and back.}

  abstract = {SUMMARY             The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

The               k               -d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an               n               record file are: insertion,               O               (log               n               ); deletion of the root,               O               (               n                                (                 k                 -1)/                 k                              ); deletion of a random node,               O               (log               n               ); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches),               O               (               n               log               n               ). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with               t               keys specified [proven maximum running time of               O               (               n                                (                 k                 -                 t                 )/                 k                              )] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of               O               (log               n               ).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that               k               -d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given.},

Perhaps it can be  best summed up as being a general quality of the appropriateness to a purpose of  any particular artefact.

With  particular reference to information systems, this view of usability is reflected in the  current draft international standard ISO 9241-11 and in the European Community  ESPRIT project MUSiC (Measuring Usability of Systems in Context) (e.g. Bevan  et al., 1991). In general, it is impossible to specify the usability of a system (i.e. its  fitness for purpose) without first defining who are the intended users of the system,  the tasks those users will perform with it, and the characteristics of the physical,  organizational and social environment in which it will be used.},

  abstract = {Software visualization tools are meant to help developers in gaining a better understanding of the code base they are involved in. Many tools only focus on either the dynamic (runtime) aspect or the static (structural) aspect of software systems. ExplorViz is such a tool that lays its focus on the runtime analysis of Java applications. It provides a visualization that is based on the city metaphor approach. In this work, ExplorViz is extended by incorporating static code properties into the software visualizations. For this purpose, the target source code base is statically analyzed based on Git commits. The analyzed data is then processed, persisted, and provided for visualization in the frontend. The result is a working prototype that is able to visualize a code city based on its code structure. Also, the visualization of the code evolution in form of a commit comparison is now possible. Furthermore, code metrics such as lines of code are being provided to assist the user in the perception of code complexity which is part of program comprehension. An usability test by means of a pluralistic walkthrough with an experienced developer/user of ExplorViz was conducted via Zoom. The prototype proved to be easy to use. The visualization of the static aspects was perceived as helpful and intuitive, as it makes use of existing and well known features of ExplorViz.},

This goes hand in hand with the fact that this kind of estimator is now provided by many software packages. On the other hand, since about three decades the discussion on bandwidth selection has been going on. Although a good part of the discussion is about nonparametric regression, this parameter choice is by no means less problematic for density estimation. This becomes obvious when reading empirical studies in which practitioners have made use of kernel densities. New contributions typically provide simulations only to show that the own selector outperforms some of the existing methods. We review existing methods and compare them on a set of designs that exhibit few bumps and exponentially falling tails. We concentrate on small and moderate sample sizes because for large ones the differences between consistent methods are often negligible, at least for practitioners. As a byproduct we find that a mixture of simple plug-in and cross-validation methods produces bandwidths with a quite stable performance.},

  abstract = {Usability is a key consideration when developing an interactive software application because of the various outcomes it can produce. Accordingly, numerous evaluation methods have been proposed, however, a recent review of usability methods concluded there is no current consensus on models applied to usability. While questionnaires are a commonly used measure, it is unclear which questionnaire(s) are most appropriate for a given context, so new usability researchers face confusion over which to select. To aid questionnaire selection, the appropriate type (post-study or post-task), general structure and content, specific advantages and disadvantages, aspects of usability covered, and psychometric quality should be considered. This paper presents a literature review and analysis of general post-study and post-task usability measures. Questionnaires are weighed up and discussed on each aspect, so practitioners can gain a holistic overview and identify relative strengths of individual questionnaires within their questionnaire type. Overall recommendations and specific questionnaire suggestions are provided for guidance, along with how future research can expand the review.}

It is not infrequent to find a researcher selecting an incorrect coefficient to measure a given association, thereby possibly rendering a false or misleading conclusion. The choice of the proper measure of association is based on, among other things, the characteristics of each of the two variables involved. This article enumerates every case that can be encountered by the researcher and provides an appropriate measure of association that can be used.},

  abstract = {Software visualization approaches for code reviews are often implemented as standalone applications, which use static code analysis. The goal is to visualize the structural changes introduced by a pull / merge request to facilitate the review process. In this way, for example, structural changes that hinder code evolution can be more easily identified, but understanding the changed program behavior is still mainly done by reading the code. For software visualization to be successful in code review, tools must be provided that go beyond an alternative representation of code changes and integrate well into the developers' daily workflow. In this paper, we report on the novel and in-progress design and implementation of a web-based approach capable of combining static and dynamic analysis data in software city visualizations. Our architectural tool design incorporates modern web technologies such as the integration into common Git hosting services. As a result, code reviewers can explore how the modified software evolves and execute its use cases, which is especially helpful for distributed software systems. In this context, developers can be directly linked from the Git hosting service's issue tracking system to the corresponding software city visualization. This approach eliminates the recurring action of manual data collection and setup. We implement our design by extending the web-based software visualization tool ExplorViz. We invite other researchers to extend our open source software and jointly research this approach. Video URL: https://youtu.be/DYxijdCEdrY},

The varimax-rotated factor pattern showed that these eight factors were clearly associated with the eight scenarios. The benefit of this research to system designers is that this three-item questionnaire has acceptable psychometric properties of reliability, sensitivity, and concurrent validity, and may be used with confidence in other, similar usability studies.}

Coefficient alpha analyses showed that the reliability of the overall summative scale was .97, and ranged from .91 to .96 for the three subscales. In the sensitivity analyses, the overall scale and all three subscales detected significant differences among the user groups; and one subscale indicated a significant system effect. Correlation analyses support the validity of the scales. The overall scale correlated highly with the sum of the After-Scenario Questionnaire ratings that participants gave after each scenario. The overall scale also correlated moderately with the percentage of successful scenario completion. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that these alternative measurements tap into a common underlying construct. This construct is probably usability, based on the content of the questionnaire items and the measurement context.},

The questionnaires address evaluation at both a global overall system level and at a more detailed scenario level. The primary goals of this article are to (a) discuss the psychometric characteristics of IBM questionnaires that measure user satisfaction with computer system usability, and (b) provide the questionnaires, with administration and scoring instructions. For scenario‐level measurement, the 3‐item After‐Scenario Questionnaire (ASQ) has excellent internal consistency, with coefficient alphas across a set of scenarios ranging from .90 to .96. For more global assessment, the Post‐Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) also has excellent internal consistency, with an overall coefficient alpha of .97. Preliminary principal factor analysis of 48 PSSUQ questionnaires suggested the presence of three factors named, after varimax rotation, System Usefulness, Information Quality, and Interface Quality, with corresponding coefficient alphas of .96, .91, and .91. Evaluation of 377 PSSUQ questionnaires (modified to allow mailing to respondents in their offices and referred to as the Computer System Usability Questionnaire, or CSUQ) confirmed the structure of the preliminary principal factor analysis. Consequently, usability practitioners can use these questionnaires to help them measure users’ satisfaction with the usability of computer systems in the context of scenario‐based usability studies.}

  abstract = {The project conceived in 1929 by Gardner Murphy and the writer aimed first to present a wide array of problems having to do with five major "attitude areas"—international relations, race relations, economic conflict, political conflict, and religion. The kind of questionnaire material falls into four classes: yes-no, multiple choice, propositions to be responded to by degrees of approval, and a series of brief newspaper narratives to be approved or disapproved in various degrees. The monograph aims to describe a technique rather than to give results. The appendix, covering ten pages, shows the method of constructing an attitude scale. A bibliography is also given.

Traditional usability metrics have shown limitations in usefulness and validity. Usability magnitude estimation is an assessment method whereby participants assign usability ‘values’ to tasks, conditions, or other user interface targets according to ratio-based number assignments. The resultant ratio-scale data is appropriate for parametric statistical analysis. This method has been used successfully in a variety of usability activities at Oracle. It has proven to be efficient, sensitive, and highly effective for comparisons using usability as a differentiator.},

  abstract = {Longitudinal studies have to do with testing over time and thus take into consideration previous user experience with a product or product versions. However, it is difficult to conduct these types of studies. Therefore the literature is sparse on examples of the explicit effect of user experience on user satisfaction metrics in industry-standard survey instruments. During a development experience in 2009, we used a cross-sectional method to look at the effects of user profiles on ratings for commercial products that use one such instrument, the System Usability Scale or SUS.Recent research has reported finding that differences in user ratings could be based on the extent of a user's prior experience with the computer system, a Web site being visited or a desktop application like Microsoft's Office suite being used. Compared to off-the-shelf office products or personal Web applications, we were curious if we would find the same experience effect for domain specialists using geosciences products in the course of their daily professional job roles. In fact, from data collected with 262 end users across different geographic locations testing two related oilfield product releases, one Web-based and one desktop-based, we found results that were quite close to early assessment studies: Users having a more extensive experience with a product tended to provide higher, more favorable, SUS scores over users with either no or limited experience with a product---and by as much as 15-16\%, regardless of the domain product type. This and other observations found during our product testing have led us to offer some practical how-to's to our internal product analysts responsible for managing product test cycles, administering instruments like the SUS to users, and reporting results to development teams.}

IDEs are often complex applications, not friendly for novice programmers, with a learning process of several weeks and with usability and satisfaction of use not always as good as expected. The Programmer eXperience (PX) is a particular case of User eXperience (UX), based on the use of the IDEs and other artifacts. We have found studies about the programmer’s behavior and work, and also articles addressed the usability and new tools proposals for IDEs. In this work, we conducted a survey to evaluate the usability of several IDEs. The survey was based on the System Usability Scale (SUS), which we adapted for the purpose of our research. We focus the study on popular IDEs such as Dev-C++, Eclipse and NetBeans. The survey was conducted in two Chilean universities and one Spanish university, with students enrolled in two undergraduate programs in Informatics Engineering. The results obtained show that the IDEs evaluated have several issues related to the usability perceived by our participants. An interview was conducted with six experienced programmers that are working in different programming environments, in order to consult them on what aspects they would like to improve the IDEs. Their comments indicate that IDEs should incorporate connection with other programmers, and also, they claim for more intuitive interfaces and understandable error messages.},

In this study, eight different usability studies were used to make a direct comparison between the SUS and usability results. A significant but small relation was found between these two scores suggesting that the SUS may be a valid measure to ordinally compare two or more systems.},

To do so, we implemented a plug-in for the Eclipse IDE which captures nearly every interaction with the IDE a developer performs when working on a programming task. This enables us to comprehensively track a developer’s behaviour, e.g., whether and when a code edit needed for solving a given task was performed, and even more interesting, what were the preceding steps that led the developer to do so. In a first experiment conducted with the new plug-in, we were able to observe action patterns and program comprehension stages that confirm results of previous studies as well as were partly only suspected until now by recent literature, but never truly observed before.Screencast of the tool: https://youtu.be/GeZI-vCdgfoClosed caption version: https://youtu.be/mgt6Q-t7U00},

  abstract = {We present a new method for data-based selection of the bandwidth in kernel density estimation which has excellent properties. It improves on a recent procedure of Park and Marron (which itself is a good method) in various ways. First, the new method has superior theoretical performance; second, it also has a computational advantage; third, the new method has reliably good performance for smooth densities in simulations, performance that is second to none in the existing literature. These methods are based on choosing the bandwidth to (approximately) minimize good quality estimates of the mean integrated squared error. The key to the success of the current procedure is the reintroduction of a non-stochastic term which was previously omitted together with use of the bandwidth to reduce bias in estimation without inflating variance.}
