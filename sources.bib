  abstract = {Software development is a complex undertaking composed of several activities that include reading, writing, and modifying source code. Indeed, previous studies have shown that the majority of the effort invested in software development is dedicated to understanding code. This includes understanding the static structure, dynamic behaviour, and evolution of the code. Given these particular characteristics, as well as the high complexity of source code, it is reasonable to consider how visualisation can facilitate source code understanding. This work proposes to extend existing software development tools with visualisations that can be used to encode the various complex features within a source code document. Further, this work establishes a design space which includes a series of visualisations that are meant to complement existing textual views of source code, as found in source code editors. Several prototype visualisations are presented in this work which utilise various visualisation techniques, such as tree visualisations techniques and visualisation techniques based on the code-map metaphor. This work also presents several experiments, where the results of these experiments indicate that combining existing software development tools with visualisations can have a positive effect on source code understanding. Additionally, the result of the experiments show that the less a visualisation is abstracted from the original textural representation of a source code document, in terms of line, token, ordering, and character information, the more likely it is that viewers can link the visualisation to the code and back.}

  abstract = {This paper develops the multidimensional binary search tree (or               k               -d tree, where               k               is the dimensionality of the search space) as a data structure for storage of information to be retrieved by associative searches. The               k               -d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an               n               record file are: insertion,               O               (log               n               ); deletion of the root,               O               (               n                                (                 k                 -1)/                 k                              ); deletion of a random node,               O               (log               n               ); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches),               O               (               n               log               n               ).

An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that               k               -d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given.},

Perhaps it can be  best summed up as being a general quality of the appropriateness to a purpose of  any particular artefact.

With  particular reference to information systems, this view of usability is reflected in the  current draft international standard ISO 9241-11 and in the European Community  ESPRIT project MUSiC (Measuring Usability of Systems in Context) (e.g. Bevan  et al., 1991). In general, it is impossible to specify the usability of a system (i.e. its  fitness for purpose) without first defining who are the intended users of the system,  the tasks those users will perform with it, and the characteristics of the physical,  organizational and social environment in which it will be used.},

  abstract = {Software visualization tools are meant to help developers in gaining a better understanding of the code base they are involved in. Many tools only focus on either the dynamic (runtime) aspect or the static (structural) aspect of software systems. ExplorViz is such a tool that lays its focus on the runtime analysis of Java applications. It provides a visualization that is based on the city metaphor approach. In this work, ExplorViz is extended by incorporating static code properties into the software visualizations. For this purpose, the target source code base is statically analyzed based on Git commits. The analyzed data is then processed, persisted, and provided for visualization in the frontend. The result is a working prototype that is able to visualize a code city based on its code structure. Also, the visualization of the code evolution in form of a commit comparison is now possible. Furthermore, code metrics such as lines of code are being provided to assist the user in the perception of code complexity which is part of program comprehension. An usability test by means of a pluralistic walkthrough with an experienced developer/user of ExplorViz was conducted via Zoom. The prototype proved to be easy to use. The visualization of the static aspects was perceived as helpful and intuitive, as it makes use of existing and well known features of ExplorViz.},

However, there are a very large number of measures or coefficients (i.e., a number that indicates the strength of the relationship between two variables) from which to choose. It is not infrequent to find a researcher selecting an incorrect coefficient to measure a given association, thereby possibly rendering a false or misleading conclusion. The choice of the proper measure of association is based on, among other things, the characteristics of each of the two variables involved.

  abstract = {Software visualization approaches for code reviews are often implemented as standalone applications, which use static code analysis. The goal is to visualize the structural changes introduced by a pull / merge request to facilitate the review process. In this way, for example, structural changes that hinder code evolution can be more easily identified, but understanding the changed program behavior is still mainly done by reading the code. For software visualization to be successful in code review, tools must be provided that go beyond an alternative representation of code changes and integrate well into the developers' daily workflow. In this paper, we report on the novel and in-progress design and implementation of a web-based approach capable of combining static and dynamic analysis data in software city visualizations. Our architectural tool design incorporates modern web technologies such as the integration into common Git hosting services. As a result, code reviewers can explore how the modified software evolves and execute its use cases, which is especially helpful for distributed software systems. In this context, developers can be directly linked from the Git hosting service's issue tracking system to the corresponding software city visualization. This approach eliminates the recurring action of manual data collection and setup. We implement our design by extending the web-based software visualization tool ExplorViz. We invite other researchers to extend our open source software and jointly research this approach. Video URL: https://youtu.be/DYxijdCEdrY},

  abstract = {To understand how developers solve programming tasks, it is necessary to observe what they are doing, i.e., what specific actions they perform, which strategies they apply and how they make use of possibly present, but not yet known or otherwise not yet available information that is needed to solve a task. To do so, we implemented a plug-in for the Eclipse IDE which captures nearly every interaction with the IDE a developer performs when working on a programming task. This enables us to comprehensively track a developer’s behaviour, e.g., whether and when a code edit needed for solving a given task was performed, and even more interesting, what were the preceding steps that led the developer to do so. In a first experiment conducted with the new plug-in, we were able to observe action patterns and program comprehension stages that confirm results of previous studies as well as were partly only suspected until now by recent literature, but never truly observed before.Screencast of the tool: https://youtu.be/GeZI-vCdgfoClosed caption version: https://youtu.be/mgt6Q-t7U00},
